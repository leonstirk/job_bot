# Job Application Bot ðŸ¤–

This Python project automates parts of the job application process by:

* Logging into Seek with a persistent browser profile
* Scraping saved job listings
* Downloading metadata and job descriptions
* Using the OpenAI API to generate tailored LaTeX cover letters
* Saving outputs to a structured folder for manual review and editing

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a `.env` file with:
```OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key```
3. Install dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Generate user prompts
```
`â”€â”€ prompts                 # Make a prompts folder (mkdir root/prompts)
    â”œâ”€â”€ prompt_template.txt # Write a prompt template file with variable fields {{ job_title }}, {{ employer }}, {{ job_description }} {{ cv_text }}.
    `â”€â”€ cv_full.txt         # Prompt text with CV information (full or summarised)

## Development status

Currently supports scraping from Seek NZ. More platforms and job description enhancements are planned. But you know, it's just a fun little script. Use it.
